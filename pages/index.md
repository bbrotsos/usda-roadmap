## US Department of Agriculture Roadmap

The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) mission is to provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, 
rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, 
the best available science, and efficient management.  

USDA’s mission is incredibly diverse and reaches far beyond what 
one might typically think of as “agriculture.”

As the following points illustrate, 
it is no exaggeration to say that USDA's work touches every American citizen, across every state, 
throughout every day:

*  The Food Safety and Inspection Service protects the nation against food-borne illness;
*  The Forest Service leads all efforts to prevent and manage wildland fires;
*  USDA is the tenth largest lender in the United States and through Rural Development has over 1 million loans in rural America; and
*  USDA finances both housing and essential community facilities such as schools, hospitals, water supplies, electricity, and broadband access.

*  Assisting Rural Communities

USDA’s FY 2014-18 strategic plan outlines five strategic goals that are essential to
executing the Department’s mission.

*  **Strategic Goal 1**: Assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self- sustaining, repopulating, and economically thriving.
*  **Strategic Goal 2**: Ensure our national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate change, while enhancing our water resources.
*  **Strategic Goal 3**: Help America promote agricultural production and biotechnology exports as America works to increase food security.
*  **Strategic Goal 4**: Ensure that all of America’s children have access to safe, nutritious, and balanced meals.
*  **Strategic Goal 5**: Create a USDA for the 21st Century that is high-performing, efficient, and adaptable.


This Enterprise Roadmap (ER) outlines the necessary technologies, capabilities, and operations necessary to
execute the Department’s mission and strategic goals. The roadmap supports the IT Strategic Goals identified 
in USDA’s IRM Strategic Plan by presenting a high-level, integrated description of the Department's business objectives, enabling IT capabilities,and target outcomes across its Agencies and Mission Areas. It was developed using Enterprise Architecture (EA) concepts and methods to describe the Department’s current architecture, future architecture, and transition plan. The ER is focuses on Department-wide initiatives and on the Department’s major IT investment portfolio, as well as, the portfolio’s effect on achieving USDA’s strategic goals and objectives in support of USDA’s seven (7) mission areas.  

USDA’s ER reflects the Department’s dynamic environment and the continuously changing USDA IT environment. The FY 2015 Roadmap:

*  Provides a holistic overview of major investments within the Department’s Mission Areas and component Agencies.
*  Demonstrates how USDA has prioritized and planned its transition strategy through a deliberate discussion of its high-priority modernization initiatives.

USDA’s ER reflects the changing program and business context of a continuously evolving Department. USDA will continue to update the Department’s Roadmap to provide the information necessary to assess USDA’s current and future architectures and the transition plan.
